        <h4>Childhood: </h4>
        <p>
            Ada childhood had a rocky start with
            Ada's parents splitting up a few months after she was born due
            to claims of her father acting immorally. Her father Lord Byron was a poet
            who had a wild side to him, he fled to Greece after rumours circulated about him being romantically involved with his half-sister [1].
            He later died in Greece when Ada was very young- all this considered she didn't have the strongest relationship with her father as she never saw him [2].
        </p>

        <p>
            She grew up with her grandmother (Lady Milbanke) until her grandmother died when Ada was just age 7.
            It was reported that she did not have the best relationship with her mother as she was strict with Ada.
            She had 'carers' who spied on her and reported back to her mother to make sure that Ada grew up in a righteous way.[3]
            She grew up being guided more towards logic, mathematics and science
            as her mother intended for her to be nothing
            like her poet father who she believed to have traits of insanity which she thought may have been passed down to Ada [2].
        </p>

        <p>
            Both Ada and her mother shared a passion for maths and were quite clever,
            when they attended Babbage's presentation on his difference engine they were very captivated by it and Ada seeked to learn more about the machine[4].
            This was an invention that he wanted to create to get rid of mistakes in lengthy calculations that were often made;
            Ada was instantly interested in this idea and wanted to know more about the machine so she asked Babbage for a copy of the machine’s blueprints [5].
