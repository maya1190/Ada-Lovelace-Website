        <h2>How is it still relevant today?</h2>
        <p>The question that you are probably wondering is how is this still relevant in this day and age?</p>
        <p>
            Within those notes that she crafted she highlighted the difference between the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine"><em>Analytical Engine</em></a> and previous calculating machines,
            she talked about how it can be programmed to solve problems that are more complex than any had done at the time [12].
            She implicated what we do today on computers, she predicted what they will be and now they perform very complex problems.
            She realised something that her fellow peers, such as
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage"><em>Babbage</em></a>, did not.
            That was that engines aren’t just bound by numbers but that the number could represent entities that isn’t just a quantity [13]. They could represent letters, images or even music!
            This thought process was vital to be documented as it represented what the future can be.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is what the future became as well!
            Think about how many can sit at home on their computers and write an email,
            watch a video or even listen to riveting lectures about Web Application!
